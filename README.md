# Genomic Data Management Framework

As genomic research data generated in Africa grows, we need to adopt open science practices and policies in data storage, reuse, reproducible pipelines and collaborative research. The big genomic data generating consortia, like H3Africa, have data storage and reuse policies but the data generated in small projects by individual researchers are not supported. From our research, during the OpenScienceKE hackathon, it was clear that the majority of institutions in Kenya do not have genomic data management and sharing policies. We seek to adopt appropriate genomic data reuse policies and frameworks and promote their adaptation in Kenya. The goal is to promote FAIR genomic data management framework.
